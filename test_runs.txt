Answer: The factions that exist in the Sundered Realm are:

1. **The Ironhold Clans** - Known for their rejection of magic and emphasis on steel and stone, they have retreated to the mountains and built fortress-cities.

2. **The Verdant Covenant** - They inhabit the Deepwood, where nature has grown in unusual ways due to the Sundering, and they focus on harmony and adaptation.

3. **The Ashward Collective** - Located in the blast lands near the original catastrophe, they are survivors who create settlements from salvage and the remnants of the old world.

4. **The Ethereal Schism** - Comprising those most affected by wild magic, they have established sanctuaries in the spaces between territories, seeking to understand the nature of the Sundering.

5. **The Remnant Assembly** - They hold the coastal strongholds and claim to be the true heirs of Aethermoor, maintaining old ceremonies and hierarchies while clinging to the legacy of the fallen kingdom.
